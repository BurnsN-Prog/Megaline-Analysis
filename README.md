# Megaline-Analysis

Project Aim:
Analyze customer usage data to determine which mobile plan — Surf or Ultimate — is more profitable for Megaline and recommend a structure for a new plan.

Tools Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

SciPy for statistical testing

Statsmodels for linear regression

Results:
Ultimate plan users generated more average revenue per month than Surf users.

Statistical tests confirmed the revenue difference was significant.

Usage patterns (data and minutes) were strong predictors of monthly revenue.
